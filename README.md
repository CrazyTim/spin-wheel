# Spin Wheel

An easy to use, themeable component for randomising choices and prizes.

## Features

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6).
- No dependencies.
- Simple, easy to use API.
- Spin by applying momentum and drag, or animate to a specific angle with easing.
- Interactable with click-drag or touch-flick.
- Responsive layout (resizes automatically to fit it's container).
- Easily themeable:
  - Give items their own color and weight.
  - Rotate labels and change alignment.
  - Draw images on items, the wheel, and the foreground.
  - Apply repeating colour sets.
- Callbacks for events like `onSpin` and `onCurrentIndexChange`.
- Clockwise and anticlockwise spinning.

## Installation

### ESM

```javascript
import {Wheel} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/spin-wheel@4.3.1/dist/spin-wheel-esm.js';
```

### IIFE

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/spin-wheel@4.3.1/dist/spin-wheel-iife.js"></script>
```

### Local

```sh
npm install spin-wheel
```

## How to make your own wheel

```javascript
// 1. Configure the wheel's properties:
const props = {
  items: [
    {
      label: 'one',
    },
    {
      label: 'two',
    },
    {
      label: 'three',
    },
  ]
}

// 2. Decide where you want it to go:
const container = document.querySelector('.wheel-container');

// 3. Create the wheel in the container and initialise it with the props:
const wheel = new Wheel(container, props);
```

## How to spin the wheel

For multiplayer games or awarding prizes with actual value, the best way is to call `Wheel.spinToItem()`. The wheel will spin for a certain duration, and once finished the pointer will be pointing at the specified item. You should always calculate the winning item on the back-end, for example:

```javascript
const winningItemIndex = await fetchWinningItemIndex();
const duration = 4000;
const easing = easing.cubicOut;
wheel.spinToItem(winningItemIndex, duration, true, 2, 1, easing)
```

If precision is not important, you can use `Wheel.spin()` to immediately start spinning the wheel at a certain speed, which will be reduced over time according to `Wheel.rotationResistance`. You can also set `Wheel.isInteractive = true` to allow the user to spin the wheel themselves by dragging or flicking.

## Configuration

Everything is easy to configure. The wheel is responsive and resizes automatically to fit it's container, so when the size of the container changes you don't have to worry about updating fiddly things like widths and font sizes. For that reason, some numeric properties are expressed as percentages, while others are expressed as pixels.

* **Percentage properties** are a percent of the container size. For example, a `Wheel.radius` of `0.9` means the wheel will fill `90%` of the container.

* **Pixel properties** are relative to a container size of `500px`. For example, a `Wheel.LineWidth` of `1` will be exactly `1px` when the container size is `500px`.

Labels are also simple to configure because the font size is calculated automatically. You can optionally set `Wheel.itemLabelFontSizeMax` (in pixels), but otherwise the largest item label will be sized to fit between `Wheel.itemLabelRadius` (percent) and  `Wheel.itemLabelRadiusMax` (percent).
