# Spin Wheel

An easy to use, themeable component for randomising choices and prizes.

## Features

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6).
- No dependencies.
- Simple, easy to use API.
- Spin by applying momentum and drag, or animate to a specific angle with easing.
- Interactable with click-drag or touch-flick.
- Responsive layout - everything in the wheel resizes automatically to fit it's container.
- Easily themeable:
  - Give items their own color and weight.
  - Rotate labels and change alignment.
  - Draw images on items, the wheel, and the canvas.
  - Apply repeating colour sets.
- Callbacks for events like `onSpin` and `onRest`.
- Clockwise and anticlockwise spinning.

## How to make your own wheel

```
npm install spin-wheel
```

```JavaScript
import {Wheel} from '../node_modules/spin-wheel/dist/spin-wheel-esm.js';

// 1. Configure the wheel's properties:
const props = {
  items: [
    {
      label: 'one',
    },
    {
      label: 'two',
    },
    {
      label: 'three',
    },
  ]
}

// 2. Decide where you want it to go:
const container = document.querySelector('.wheel-container');

// 3. Create the wheel in the container and initialise it with the props:
const wheel = new Wheel(container, props);
```

## Examples

- [Basic ESM usage](https://crazytim.github.io/spin-wheel/examples/esm)
- [Basic IIFE usage](https://crazytim.github.io/spin-wheel/examples/iife)
- [Themes](https://crazytim.github.io/spin-wheel/examples/themes)
- [Spin to a specific item](https://crazytim.github.io/spin-wheel/examples/spin-to-item)

## Configuration

For example configurations see [./examples/themes/js/props.js](https://github.com/CrazyTim/spin-wheel/blob/master/examples/themes/js/props.js).

Everything is easy to configure. The wheel is responsive and resizes automatically to fit it's container, so when the size of the container changes you don't have to worry about updating fiddly things like widths and font sizes. For that reason, some numeric properties are expressed as percentages, while others are expressed as pixels.

* **Percentage properties** are a percent of the size of the canvas. For example, a `Wheel.radius` of `0.9` means the wheel will fill `90%` of the canvas.

* **Pixel properties** are relative to a canvas size of `500px`. For example, a `Wheel.LineWidth` of `1` will be exactly `1px` when the canvas size is `500px`.

Labels are also simple to configure because the font size is calculated automatically. You can optionally set `Wheel.itemLabelFontSizeMax` (in pixels), but otherwise the largest item label will be sized to fit between `Wheel.itemLabelRadius` (percent) and  `Wheel.itemLabelRadiusMax` (percent).

Here's a handy diagram:

## Spinning the wheel

There are three ways to spin the wheel

1. When `Wheel.isInteractive == true`, the user can interact with the wheel by clicking and dragging (or flicking on touch screens) within the bounds of `Wheel.radius`.

2. By calling `Wheel.spin()`. The wheel will animate based on the properties `Wheel.rotationSpeed` and `Wheel.rotationResistance` (these properties can also be changed directly).

3. By calling `Wheel.spinToAngle()`. The wheel will animate for the specified duration, finishing at the specified angle.

## Calculating the winning item

For non-trivial applications (such as multiplayer games, or awarding prizes with actual value) you should always calculate the winning item on the back-end and only use the front-end to display the result. Use `Wheel.spinToAngle()` for this purpose. For example:

```JavaScript
const winningItemIndex = 2; // TODO: calculate the winning item on the back-end.
const winningAngle = wheel.items[winningItemIndex].getRandomAngle();
wheel.spinToAngle(winningAngle, 5500);
```
